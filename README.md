midori
======

Japanese dictionary Android app

Dependencies:
- kivy/python-for-android
- pyparsing

This is an Android version of my favorite Japanese-English dictionary app.
I found the sqlite3 database in the original app's folder on my jailbroken iPad.

The skeleton database midori.db is limited to entries that contain the word 'example'. This is to avoid breaching any copyrights.
